# Open-Source Based SOC: A Future of Empowerment
The future of SOCs is open-source, and this project is your gateway to that future. Embrace the cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and community-driven power to build a security watchtower that empowers your organization to stand tall against the ever-evolving threats of the digital age.
## Why Open-Source?
Building an open-source SOC doesn't mean compromising on functionality.There's a plethora of powerful tools available to cover all aspects of security operations. Open source brings transparency, flexibility, and a vibrant community to the table, offering several advantages:
* Cost-Effective: Ditch the hefty price tags and embrace free, community-driven tools. Security shouldn't be a privilege reserved for the financially fortified.
* Customization: Craft your SOC to your specific needs. Open-source allows you to bend and shape the tools to fit your workflows, not the other way around.
* Transparency and Trust: Open code means vulnerabilities are exposed and patched swiftly, fostering trust and confidence in your SOC's capabilities.
* Community of Vigilance: Never stand alone. A dedicated open-source community provides constant updates, bug fixes, and support, ensuring your SOC evolves alongside the threats.

## Building Your Own Open-Source based SOC:
Creating an effective open-source SOC requires careful planning and execution. and also have to concern about these following staffs:
* Assessment: Identify your security needs and resources to design the appropriate architecture.
* Tool Selection: Choose the open-source tools that best fit your specific requirements and workflows.
* Integration: Seamlessly integrate chosen tools for efficient data flow and analysis.
* Team Training: Invest in training your team to proficiently use and manage the open-source tools.
* Community Engagement: Actively participate in the open-source community to benefit from updates, support, and collaboration.

## Tools(Open-Source) used in My project :
My project is fully open source based and it is not just a collection of tools; it's a comprehensive SOC ecosystem designed for efficient threat detection, investigation, and response. Here's what you get:
* Log Management and SIEM: Wazuh Manager (ElK stack,Wazuh server, Kibana) and Graylog offer centralized log collection, analysis, and visualization.
* Intrusion Detection and Prevention: Snort and Suricata monitor network traffic for malicious activity, while Zeek or Zabbix (formerly Bro) provides deep network analysis.
* Threat Intelligence: MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) and OpenCTI facilitates collaboration and intelligence sharing among security teams.
* Security Orchestration and Response(SOAR): Shuffle automates incident response workflows, streamlining investigation and remediation.
* Case Management: TheHive is very powerfull tools to generates and keep tracks of security case events.
* Vulnerability Management: OpenVAS scans systems for vulnerabilities, while Nessus offers in-depth vulnerability assessment.
